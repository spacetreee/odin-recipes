        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>The lesser know relative of pho is bun bo hue. Like pho, it requires 
            hours of simmering the broth to bring out the rich flavor of the 
            ingredients. While time consuming, the delightful taste of the dish
            will make the cooking worthwhile.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Clean the meat: Add all meat to a stock pot and enough water
                 to submerge it, bring to a boil. Drain and rinse thoroughly
                  under running water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the meat, broth, lemongrass and onions to the pot and fill
                 with water almost to the brim. Bring to a boil then drop the
                 heat to medium-high to maintain a low boil. Add the seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let it simmer and periodically check the meats for doneness 
                and remove them as they finish cooking. The pork should be 
                done after about an hour, the beef can vary between 2-3 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                After all the meat has removed, let it cool, then slice it. 
                Adjust seasoning and add water to the broth pot if necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the aromatics & coloring then add it to the pot.
            </li>
            <li>Boil noodles according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Assemble your bowl, and serve with herbs and veg on a side 
                platter.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Red Coloring and Aromatics</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sauté seeds in oil on medium heat until the seeds give 
                up the bright red color, then remove the seeds.
            </li>
            <li>Add shallots and garlic, sauté until brown.</li>
            <li>Add all of this to the pot of broth for color.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pork blood</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The easiest thing to do is just buy it already cooked 
                and boil just to heat it up. If you use the raw type 
                like we did for this recipe, cut into 1″ cubes and boil 
                for 30-45 minutes
            </li>
        </ol>
