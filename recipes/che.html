            <li>4 cup shaved ice</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Mung Bean Layer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse ½ cup of mung bean under running water.</li>
            <li>In a container, add ½ cup dried mung bean and 
                four cups of water. Soak the beans for at least 
                four hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>After soaking, drain the mung beans and add 
                to your rice cooker. Add ¾ cup of water and 
                lose the lid. Use the regular rice option or 
                put a 40 minute timer to cook the beans.
            </li>
            <li>
                After the rice cooker is done, use your paddle 
                to mash the beans (this should be very easy 
                since the beans have softened immensely). Add 
                three tablespoons of sugar and continue to mash 
                and mix. Move to a container to rest, and cool 
                in the fridge until assembly.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Pandan Jelly Layer</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, bring the water to a boil and 
                mix in the agar agar and sugar until it thoroughly 
                dissolves. Lower the heat and add the pandan extract. 
                Mix this until the liquid turns green and move to 
                a glass container to cool.
            </li>
            <li>
                When it’s at room temperature, move to the fridge 
                to chill for two hours. The pandan jelly should be 
                firm to the touch and easily remove from the glass 
                container.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cut the jelly into your preferred shape to eat. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Coconut Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a saucepan, mix together the coconut cream, 
                sugar, and salt over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the tapioca starch carefully with a whisk. 
                Cook for about one to two minutes until it 
                thickens to the consistency of diluted pudding.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove from the heat and move to a glass container 
                to cool. Chill in the fridge until time of assembly.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Layer the ingredients in the order of red bean 
                paste, mung beans, pandan helly, shaved ice, 
                and coconut sauce. Or layered it as preferred.
            </li>
        </ol>
