    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A custard dessert that's easy to make and fun to eat.
        The best part about this dish is the moment when you
        flip the flan over on itself and let it fall from its 
        container, releasing the caramel goo from the bottom.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Caramel</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Custard</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups whole milk</li>
        <li>1 cup sugar</li>
        <li>5 large whole eggs, plug 5 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Place a small bowl 
            of cold water and a pastry brush near the stove top. 
            Place a 9-inch cake pan in a large roasting pan. 
            Bring a large kettle or pot of water to a boil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the caramel: In a saucepan over medium-high heat, 
            mix sugar and 3 tablespoons water, stirring to combine. 
            Do not stir again. Cook, washing down the sides of the 
            pan with a pastry brush dipped in water, or cover with 
            a tight-fitting lid, to prevent crystals from forming, 
            until caramel is amber, about 8 minutes, swirling pan 
            to color evenly. Pour into cake pan, swirling to coat bottom evenly.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make the custard: In a small saucepan, heat milk with 
            1/2 cup sugar over medium just until mixture starts to 
            steam and bubble around the edges, 5 to 6 minutes (do not let it boil).
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, yolks, remaining 1/2 
            cup sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Add ladle of hot 
            milk mixture to the egg mixture and whisk to combine. 
            (This is called tempering, and it prevents the eggs from curdling.) 
            Add two more ladles of milk mixture, one at a time, 
            whisking to combine after each addition. Gradually 
            whisk in remaining milk mixture. Strain through a fine 
            sieve into a large measuring cup or a bowl (to remove 
            any cooked bits of egg). Stir in vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour custard into cake pan. Place roasting pan in oven. 
            Add enough boiling water to pan to come halfway up the 
            sides of the pan. Bake until custard is just set (it 
            should tremble slightly in center when shaken), about 
            50 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove roasting pan from oven. Use tongs to carefully 
            remove pan from hot-water bath and place on a wire rack 
            for 30 minutes. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for 
            at least 8 hours (or up to 3 days). To unmold, run a 
            sharp knife around the flan, and place a rimmed serving 
            plate upside down over the top. Invert, and gently lift 
            pan to remove. Serve immediately.
